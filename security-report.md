# Security Audit Report - Dotfiles Repository

## Executive Summary

This security audit was conducted to assess the safety of making this dotfiles repository public on GitHub. The repository contains primarily configuration files for various development tools and applications. **Overall Assessment: SAFE FOR PUBLIC RELEASE** with minor privacy considerations.

The repository contains standard dotfiles configurations with no critical security vulnerabilities or sensitive credentials. One item of personal information was identified that should be considered before public release.

## Risk Assessment Summary
- **Critical Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **High Vulnerabilities**: 0  
- **Medium Vulnerabilities**: 0
- **Low Privacy Concerns**: 1

## Low Privacy Concerns

### Personal Information Exposure
- **Location**: `/git/.config/git/config` (lines 1-2)
- **Description**: Git configuration contains real name and email address
- **Information Exposed**: 
  ```
  name = Marco Peluso
  email = marco@pelu.so
  ```
- **Impact**: Personal identity information will be publicly visible, though this is common in public dotfiles repositories
- **Remediation Options**:
  - [ ] Keep as-is (acceptable for public dotfiles - common practice)
  - [ ] Replace with placeholder values (e.g., "Your Name", "your.email@example.com")
  - [ ] Add template instructions in README for users to customize
- **References**: This is standard practice in most public dotfiles repositories

## Security Strengths Identified

### Proper Secret Management
- **Claude AI Settings**: Global gitignore properly excludes `.claude/settings.local.json` files
- **System Files**: Appropriately ignores `.DS_Store` files
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: No API keys, tokens, passwords, or other secrets found in any configuration files

### Secure Configuration Practices
- **Path Security**: All PATH modifications use standard, safe directories (`$HOME/.local/bin`, `$HOME/.cargo/bin`, etc.)
- **Shell Configuration**: ZSH configurations follow security best practices with no dangerous commands or insecure settings
- **Tool Configurations**: Application configs (Alacritty, Neovim, Starship, etc.) contain only standard customization settings

### Privacy Protection
- **No Internal References**: No internal company URLs, server addresses, or work-related configurations found
- **No Personal Paths**: File paths use standard XDG directories and environment variables rather than hardcoded personal paths
- **No Sensitive File References**: No references to private keys, certificates, or other sensitive files

## Files Reviewed (No Issues Found)

The following critical files were thoroughly examined and found to be safe:

- `/zsh/.zshenv` - Contains only Cargo environment setup
- `/zsh/.config/zsh/.zshrc` - Standard shell configuration with aliases and tool integrations
- `/zsh/.config/zsh/.zprofile` - PATH modifications and tool initialization
- `/sketchybar/.config/sketchybar/environment` - Only contains local config directory variables
- `/scripts/.local/bin/toggle-recording-settings` - Screen recording utility script with no sensitive data
- All TOML, CONF, and other configuration files - Standard application settings only

## General Security Recommendations

- [ ] Consider adding a security section to the README explaining what users should customize
- [ ] Add template configuration files with placeholder values for personal information
- [ ] Consider documenting which files users should review before using

## Public Release Assessment

**RECOMMENDATION: SAFE TO MAKE PUBLIC** 

This dotfiles repository follows security best practices and contains no sensitive information that would pose security risks if made public. The only consideration is the personal name and email in the Git configuration, which is a standard and acceptable practice in public dotfiles repositories.

The repository demonstrates good security hygiene with:
- Proper use of gitignore for sensitive files
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Standard configuration practices
- No internal/corporate information exposure

## Additional Notes

This is a well-maintained dotfiles repository that other developers could safely reference or use as a starting point for their own configurations. The tools and configurations represented are standard in the development community and pose no security concerns.
