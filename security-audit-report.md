# Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-08-01  
**Repository:** ~/.dotfiles  
**Purpose:** Pre-public release security assessment  
**Auditor:** Claude Code Security Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

This dotfiles repository has been analyzed for security vulnerabilities and sensitive data exposure before public release. The audit revealed **CRITICAL** security issues that must be addressed immediately, along with several high and medium priority concerns.

**Overall Risk Assessment:** ⚠️ **HIGH RISK** - Repository contains sensitive infrastructure information that could facilitate attacks.

**Key Findings:**
- SSH configuration with production server details exposed
- Personal file system paths in Claude settings
- Backup files containing configuration snapshots
- Missing comprehensive .gitignore patterns

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Production Server Information Exposure
- **Location**: `/ssh/.ssh/config` (lines 40-70)
- **Severity**: 🔴 **CRITICAL**
- **Description**: SSH configuration file contains detailed production infrastructure information including:
  - Production server hostnames (`prod.example.com`, `bastion.example.com`)
  - Internal network IP addresses (`192.168.1.100`, `10.0.1.50`)
  - AWS EC2 instance hostnames and regions
  - Service account usernames (`deploy`, `jump-user`, `ec2-user`)
  - SSH key file references for production systems

- **Impact**: 
  - Attackers gain detailed knowledge of infrastructure layout
  - Server hostnames can be used for reconnaissance
  - Internal IP ranges reveal network topology
  - Username enumeration for brute force attacks

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Remove entire `/ssh/` directory from repository
  - [ ] Add `ssh/` to root `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Create sanitized example SSH config with placeholder values
  - [ ] Audit all existing commits for SSH config exposure
  - [ ] Consider changing production server hostnames if feasible
  - [ ] Review access logs for unusual activity

## High Vulnerabilities

### 2. Personal File System Path Disclosure
- **Location**: `/.claude/settings.local.json`
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Description**: Claude IDE settings file contains absolute file system paths revealing:
  - Full username (`maccredyreina`)
  - Complete directory structure
  - Personal configuration locations

- **Impact**:
  - Username enumeration for social engineering
  - File system structure disclosure aids in attack planning
  - Personal information exposure

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Remove `/.claude/` directory from repository
  - [ ] Add `.claude/` to root `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Replace absolute paths with relative paths where needed
  - [ ] Create sanitized example Claude settings file

### 3. Backup File Exposure
- **Location**: `/aerospace/.config/aerospace/aerospace.toml.backup*`
- **Severity**: 🟠 **HIGH**
- **Description**: Configuration backup files remain in repository, potentially containing:
  - Previous configurations with sensitive data
  - Experimental settings that weren't meant for public release
  - Personal preferences and system details

- **Impact**:
  - Additional attack surface through backup files
  - Potential exposure of reverted sensitive configurations

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Remove all `.backup*` files from repository
  - [ ] Add `*.backup*` pattern to `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Add `*.bak`, `*~`, `*.orig` patterns to `.gitignore`
  - [ ] Audit git history for backup files in previous commits

## Medium Vulnerabilities

### 4. GitHub Profile Information
- **Location**: `/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (line 26)
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: Personal profile contains GitHub username, which could be used for:
  - Profile enumeration
  - Social engineering attacks
  - Cross-platform identity correlation

- **Impact**:
  - Facilitates targeted attacks
  - Enables social engineering campaigns

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Replace specific GitHub username with placeholder
  - [ ] Consider using a separate public GitHub profile
  - [ ] Review what information is publicly available on linked profiles

### 5. SSH Key Generation in Setup Script
- **Location**: `/setup.sh` (lines 182-183)
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: Setup script prompts for email and generates SSH keys, which could:
  - Be misused if users don't understand the implications
  - Generate keys with weak entropy if run in certain environments

- **Impact**:
  - Potential weak key generation
  - User confusion about key management

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Add warnings about SSH key security
  - [ ] Include instructions for proper key management
  - [ ] Add option to skip SSH key generation
  - [ ] Document key rotation practices

### 6. Git Submodule Security
- **Location**: `/.gitmodules`, embedded git repositories
- **Severity**: 🟡 **MEDIUM**
- **Description**: Repository contains nested Git repositories and submodules which could:
  - Introduce vulnerabilities from third-party code
  - Create supply chain attack vectors
  - Contain sensitive information in submodule histories

- **Impact**:
  - Supply chain security risks
  - Indirect exposure through submodule vulnerabilities

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Audit all submodules for security issues
  - [ ] Pin submodules to specific secure versions
  - [ ] Review submodule update procedures
  - [ ] Consider removing unused submodules

---

## Low Vulnerabilities

### 7. Application Configuration Disclosure
- **Location**: Various configuration files
- **Severity**: 🟢 **LOW**
- **Description**: Configuration files reveal:
  - Preferred applications and tools
  - Workflow patterns
  - System preferences

- **Impact**:
  - Minor information disclosure for social engineering
  - Attack surface enumeration

- **Remediation Checklist**:
  - [ ] Review configurations for unnecessary detail
  - [ ] Use generic application names where possible
  - [ ] Remove version-specific configurations

---

## General Security Recommendations

## Testing and Validation

Before making the repository public:

```bash
# Check for remaining sensitive patterns
grep -r -i "password\|secret\|key\|token\|credential" /path/to/dotfiles

# Verify SSH directory removal
ls -la /path/to/dotfiles/ssh 2>/dev/null && echo "SSH directory still exists!"

# Check for backup files
find /path/to/dotfiles -name "*.backup*" -o -name "*.bak" -o -name "*~"

# Validate .gitignore effectiveness
git check-ignore -v ssh/ .claude/ *.backup
```

## Incident Response

If this repository has already been made public with sensitive data:

1. **Immediately make repository private**
2. **Contact platform support** to purge cached versions
3. **Rotate all exposed credentials** (SSH keys, passwords, tokens)
4. **Monitor access logs** for unusual activity
5. **Consider changing hostnames** if infrastructure details were exposed
6. **Conduct forensic analysis** of who may have accessed the data
